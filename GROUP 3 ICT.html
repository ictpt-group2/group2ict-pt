	<p> The purpose of this task is for us to learn how to 
	    upload an html document online.  By learning HTML, students develop an understanding 	of how websites work and how they can create their own. Even a little bit of HTML 	understanding makes using drag-and-drop website builders easier and smoother 	experiences.</p>
	<h3>How will html will help you in the future?</h3>
	<p>HTML is a great foundation for kids who want to pursue a career in development, as it 	opens up many opportunities to learn new coding       languages 	and build upon 	their skills. Additionally, HTML can lead to careers in web 	design, graphic design, 	and even user experience design.</p>
